# Please do this stuff :)
## Not Ordered

### Random Ideas:
- [ ] See how well optifine works with the modpack (prob lots of glitches, so might not be useful at all)
- [ ] Find a way to make the ender dragon fight harder
- [ ] Find a way to add more bosses
- [ ] Make quark matrix enchanting pre-endgame. Lock regular enchanting to post-endgame.
- [ ] One or two more dimension mods
- [ ] A mod that properly uses curios API (suggested Artifacts)
- [ ] Add mod that makes end interesting (nullscape does not work)
- [ ] Maybe have a custom font for the modpack

### Mod Suggestions: (please only remove items from this list after they have been added/discussed fully)
- [ ] [MrCrafish's Furniture Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mrcrayfish-furniture-mod)
- [ ] [Building Gadgets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/building-gadgets) (maybe make recipe harder)
- [ ] [Neat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/neat)
- [ ] [Macaw's Paintings](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/macaws-paintings)
- [ ] [Selectable Painting](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/selectable-painting)
- [ ] [Ars Nouveau](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ars-nouveau) (maybe tweak some recipes to make it balanced)
- [ ] [Artifacts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/artifacts) (OP items can be tweaked)
- [ ] [Balanced Flight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/balanced-flight) (Disable ascended ring)
- [ ] [Epic Fight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/epic-fight-mod) (Amazing mod that adds minecraft dungeons-like RPG aspect, makes Neat obsolete, would add a ton of work, but also a ton of fun to gameplay)
- [ ] [Apotheosis](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apotheosis) (only for Enchantment, Spawner module (make the spawner modifiers expensive) and maybe the village module)

### Mods to add after they update (mods we really want to add but are stuck in older versions):
- [ ] [Botania](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/botania)
- [ ] Magnesium

### Look at and tweak the configs of:
- [ ] Carry On (for blacklisting/whitelisting blocks)
- [ ] Custom Villager Trades (add villager trades)
- [ ] Default Options (change default keybinds to not be conflicting)
- [ ] Explorer's compass (remove OP sturctures like stronghold). Also tweak recipe so it is post-dragon-fight (maybe require something from end cities)
- [ ] Paintings ++ (Add paintings to json file and add more paintings)
- [ ] Villager Names (add more custom names)
- [ ] wthit (Add blocks to blacklist)
- [ ] Enchantment Descriptions (add descriptions for all enchantments if not already existing)
- [ ] JourneyMap (set up server-side configs)


### KubeJS (Add/Tweak recipes for):
