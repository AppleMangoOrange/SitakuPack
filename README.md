# SitakuPack
This pack is made for upcoming Sitaku modpack considerations. Aims to stick to vanilla while adding popular mods, to not change too many things.

## NOTE:
- When installing this modpack on a server, make sure to <b>remove the Rubidium mod<b> as it is incompatible on the server side. The mod dev has not added any checks to disable it server-side so it will have to be removed manually.
